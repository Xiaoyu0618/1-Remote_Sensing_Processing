# MATLAB Scripts for Raster Trend Analysis

This folder contains MATLAB implementations of core time-series trend analysis workflows in environmental remote sensing, including the Mann–Kendall test, Sen’s slope estimation, and NetCDF-to-GeoTIFF conversion.

## Script Overview

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **1-mk_sen_trend.m** | Perform Mann–Kendall statistical test and Sen’s slope calculation to detect trend direction and significance for raster time series |
| **2-NC_TIF_12m.m** | Convert monthly/annual NetCDF data to geographically referenced GeoTIFFs |

## Application Scenarios

- Long-term climate trend detection  
- Ecosystem monitoring
